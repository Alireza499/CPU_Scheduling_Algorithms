# CPU Scheduling Methods Notebook

![CPU Scheduling](scheduling_image.png) <!-- Replace with an image illustrating CPU scheduling -->

This is a Colab notebook that explores various CPU scheduling methods commonly used in operating systems. The notebook provides explanations, code examples, and visualizations for the following scheduling algorithms:

- First-Come, First-Served (FIFO)
- Shortest Job Next (SJN) or Shortest Job First (SJF)
- Round Robin (RR)

Each scheduling method has its own section in the notebook, including an overview of the algorithm, a step-by-step explanation, and code snippets in Python to demonstrate how the algorithm works.

## Introduction

In the field of operating systems, CPU scheduling plays a crucial role in determining the order in which processes are executed on a computer's CPU. This notebook provides insights into three common CPU scheduling methods and their advantages and limitations.

## First-Come, First-Served (FIFO)

The FIFO scheduling algorithm is one of the simplest methods, where processes are executed in the order they arrive in the ready queue. This section explains the algorithm's operation and provides a Python code example to illustrate the concept.

## Shortest Job Next (SJN) or Shortest Job First (SJF)

The SJN/SJF scheduling algorithm aims to minimize the average waiting time by executing the process with the shortest burst time next. The notebook describes how this algorithm works and includes a Python code example for better understanding.

## Round Robin (RR)

Round Robin is a preemptive scheduling algorithm that assigns each process a fixed time slice (quantum) to execute. The notebook section covers the round-robin approach and includes a Python code snippet to simulate the scheduling.

## Usage

To explore the notebook, you can either clone the repository and open the `.ipynb` file in Google Colab or directly open the notebook using the following link: [Open in Colab](colab_link_here).

Feel free to experiment with the code, run simulations, and visualize the results to gain a deeper understanding of how these scheduling methods work.
